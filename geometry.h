// fundamentals.

// enum encoding the sequence of cube face images in the cubemap
// This is the sequence used for openEXR cubmap layout. The top
// and bottom squares are oriented so as to align with the back
// image. Of course, the labels are debatable: my understanding
// of 'front' is 'aligned with the image center'. If one were to
// associate 'front' with the wrap-around point of the full
// spherical, the labels would be different.

// order': if you have a stack of prints in front of you and read
// them, your eyes move first left to right inside the line, then
// top to bottom from line to line, then, moving to the next pages,
// forward in the stack. Using this order also makes the first two
// components agree with normal image indexing conventions, namely
// x is to the right and y down. Note that I put the fastest-moving
// index first, which is 'fortran' style, whereas C/C++ use the
// opposite order for nD arrays.

// order (next to a drawing which says differently, see this issue:
// https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/issues/1687)

// quote:
// We assume that a camera is located at the origin, O, of a 3D
// camera coordinate system. The camera looks along the positive z
// axis. The positive x and y axes correspond to the cameraâ€™s left
// and up directions.
